# org-checkbox README

Add checkbox highlighting to `org` and `md` grammars.

## Description

This grammar for the [VSCode text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) adds coloring for unordered list checkboxes in `org-mode` and `markdown` text. This facilitates creating simple [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com/) files using [`org-mode`](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_org_markup.html) or [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

The package is written by [Jacob Levernier](https://adunumdatum.org), and is a port of a [similar extension for the Atom text editor](https://github.com/publicus/atom-language-org-checkboxes), also by Jacob Levernier, which was released under an [MIT license](https://github.com/publicus/atom-language-org-checkboxes/blob/master/LICENSE).

It highlights the following:

- `- []`, `- [ ]`: Todo
- `- [X]`, `- [x]`: Done
- `- [V]`: Done, but on a different day (Date or reference goes in parentheses at the end of the line)
- `- [>]`: Next / Scheduled
- `- [<]`: Migrated
- `- [/]`: Right now / In progress
- `- [O]`, `- [o]`: Waiting on someone else

The package also renders highlighting for `org-mode` and `markdown` syntaxes.

## Use

1. Install the extension through VScode (see below).
1. (Optional) Enable colors (vs. manually setting colors): In VSCode, enable the sidebar (`Cmd + b`), go to the Extensions tab, scroll through the enabled extensions until you find `org-checkbox`. Click on the cogwheel icon next to `org-checkbox`, and click "Set Color Theme". Doing so will set the editor to a modified version of the [Solarized Light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color scheme (as in the screenshot above).
1. In VSCode, set the language for the document as `Org` or `Markdown`.

I recommend this `org-mode`-based style for bullet-journal entries:

```org
* 1970-01-01 Thursday

  - [ ] Item 1
    - [ ] Sub-item 1
  - [ ] Item 2

  - O Event 1
  - O Event 2

  - Note 1
    - Sub-note 1
      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
        Some block-quote contents.
      #+END_QUOTE
```

By indenting, you can use VSCode's `Editor: Fold Current Row` / `Editor: Unfold Current Row` commands (from the `Ctrl + Shift + P` / `Cmd + Shift + P` menu) to collapse sections of your journal for easier reading.

This approach also works well with [`Orgzly`](http://www.orgzly.com/) for Android, which can sync org-mode files using a service such as [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) or [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/), and allows checking boxes with a tap.

## Developing

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
- Examine tokenization using `Cmd+Shift+P -> Developer: Inspect TM Scopes`
- To add features such as intellisense, hovers and validators check out the VS Code extenders documentation at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs

### Building / Installing

1. Run `vsce package`

- Rather than manually copying the extension into `~/.vscode/extensions/`, this step will show any errors in the package.

1. Run `code --install-extension <path/to/package/file>` to copy the extension into `~/.vscode/extensions/`
1. Run `Cmd+Shift+P --> Developer: Reload Window` to reload VSCode.
1. Confirm that the extension is listed in the sidebar Extensions tab.

- To publish the extension, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
